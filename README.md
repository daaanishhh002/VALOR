<h1 align="center">VALOR — Vision-Based Autonomous Location and Obstacle-Avoidance Robot</h1>

An autonomous mobile robot designed to utilize **computer vision** for navigation and obstacle avoidance, eliminating the need for expensive sensors such as LIDAR. This system processes visual input in real time to detect obstacles, opt safe paths, and control the robot’s movement in sparse/open outdoor environments. 

The project was undertaken as my **Final Year Engineering Project**, where I served as the **Project Head**, leading the design, development, and integration of both software and hardware components.
